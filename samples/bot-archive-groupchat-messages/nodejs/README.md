## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account (not a guest account)
-  [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-  [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or equivalent tunneling solution
-  [M365 developer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) or access to a Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app.

## To try this sample

> Note these instructions are for running the sample on your local machine, the tunnelling solution is required because
> the Teams service needs to call into the bot.

### 1. Setup for Bot SSO
In Azure portal, create a [Bot Framework registration resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-authentication?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=csharp%2Caadv2).

- Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)

## Instruction on setting connection string for bot authentication on the behalf of user

1. In the Azure portal, select your resource group from the dashboard.
2. Select your bot channel registration link.
3. Open the resource page and select Configuration under Settings.
4. Select Add OAuth Connection Settings.
5. Complete the form as follows:

    a. **Name:** Enter a name for the connection. You'll use this name in your bot in the appsettings.json file. For example BotTeamsAuthADv1.

    b. **Service Provider:** Select Azure Active Directory v2. Once you select this, the Azure AD-specific fields will be displayed.

    c. **Client id:** Enter the Application (client) ID .

    d. **Client secret:** Enter the Application (client) secret.

    e. Provide **Scopes** like "User.Read Chat.ReadWrite ChatMessage.Read"

6. Go to the Azure portal where app registration is created.
 
    a. Add this permission to app registration
    - Chat.ReadWrite
    - ChatMessage.Read
    ![Permissions](Images/permissions.png)

    b.  Under left menu, select  **Authentication**  under  **Manage**  section.
    - Select 'Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant)' under Supported account types and click "+Add a platform".
    -  On the flyout menu, Select "Web"    
    -  Add  `https://token.botframework.com/.auth/web/redirect`  under Redirect URLs and click Configure button.
    -  Once the flyout menu close, scroll bottom to section 'Implicit Grant' and select check boxes "Access tokens" and "ID tokens" and click "Save" at the top bar.

### 2. Run your bot sample
1) Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```

2) In a terminal, navigate to `samples/bot-archive-groupchat-messages/nodejs`

3) Install modules

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4) Run ngrok - point to port 3978

    ```bash
    ngrok http -host-header=rewrite 3978
    ```
5) Update the `.env` configuration for the bot to use the `MicrosoftAppId` and `MicrosoftAppPassword` and `ConnectionName` from the Bot Framework registration. (Note that the MicrosoftAppId is the AppId created in step 1 (Setup for Bot SSO), the MicrosoftAppPassword is referred to as the "client secret" in step 1 (Setup for Bot SSO) and you can always create a new client secret anytime.)

6) Run your bot at the command line:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
- **Manually update the manifest.json**
    - Edit the `manifest.json` contained in the  `/appPackage` folder to and fill in MicrosoftAppId (that was created in step 1 and it is the same value of MicrosoftAppId as in `.env` file) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `<<MICROSOFT-APP-ID>>` (depending on the scenario it may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - In the valid domains section of the manifest update your ngrok url `{<<ngrokid>>.ngrok.io}`. 
    - Zip up the contents of the `/appPackage` folder to create a `manifest.zip`
    - Upload the `manifest.zip` to Teams (in the left-bottom *Apps* view, click "Upload a custom app")

    > IMPORTANT: The manifest file in this app adds "token.botframework.com" to the list of `validDomains`. This must be included in any bot that uses the Bot Framework OAuth flow.

## Interacting with the bot in GroupChat

Select a groupchat and add the bot to chat.

Send `getchat` message to the bot, you will recieve a consent card by the bot in your personal scope.
