## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or equivalent tunnelling solution

### Register your Teams Auth SSO with Azure AD

1. Register a new application in the [Azure Active Directory – App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.
2. Select **New Registration** and on the *register an application page*, set following values:
    * Set **name** to your app name.
    * Choose the **supported account types** (any account type will work)
    * Leave **Redirect URI** empty.
    * Choose **Register**.
3. On the overview page, copy and save the **Application (client) ID, Directory (tenant) ID**. You’ll need those later when updating your Teams application manifest and in the appsettings.json.
4. Under **Manage**, select **Expose an API**. 
5. Select the **Set** link to generate the Application ID URI in the form of `api://{AppID}`. Insert your fully qualified domain name (with a forward slash "/" appended to the end) between the double forward slashes and the GUID. The entire ID should have the form of: `api://fully-qualified-domain-name/{AppID}`
    * ex: `api://%ngrokDomain%.ngrok.io/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`.
6. Select the **Add a scope** button. In the panel that opens, enter `access_as_user` as the **Scope name**.
7. Set **Who can consent?** to `Admins and users`
8. Fill in the fields for configuring the admin and user consent prompts with values that are appropriate for the `access_as_user` scope:
    * **Admin consent title:** Teams can access the user’s profile.
    * **Admin consent description**: Allows Teams to call the app’s web APIs as the current user.
    * **User consent title**: Teams can access the user profile and make requests on the user's behalf.
    * **User consent description:** Enable Teams to call this app’s APIs with the same rights as the user.
9. Ensure that **State** is set to **Enabled**
10. Select **Add scope**
    * The domain part of the **Scope name** displayed just below the text field should automatically match the **Application ID** URI set in the previous step, with `/access_as_user` appended to the end:
        * `api://[ngrokDomain].ngrok.io/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/access_as_user.
11. In the **Authorized client applications** section, identify the applications that you want to authorize for your app’s web application. Each of the following IDs needs to be entered:
    * `1fec8e78-bce4-4aaf-ab1b-5451cc387264` (Teams mobile/desktop application)
    * `5e3ce6c0-2b1f-4285-8d4b-75ee78787346` (Teams web application)
12. Navigate to **API Permissions**, and make sure to add the follow permissions:
-   Select Add a permission
-   Select Microsoft Graph -\> Delegated permissions.
    - `User.Read` (enabled by default)
    - `Directory.Read.All`
    - `ChatMessage.Send`
    - `Chat.ReadWrite`
    - `TeamsActivity.Send`
    - `TeamsAppInstallation.ReadForUser.All`.

**Note** Your need to add `TeamsActivity.Send` and `Directory.Read.All` as Application level permissions too.

-   Click on Add permissions. Please make sure to grant the admin consent for the required permissions.
13. Navigate to **Authentication**
    If an app hasn't been granted IT admin consent, users will have to provide consent the first time they use an app.
    Set a redirect URI:
    * Select **Add a platform**.
    * Select **web**.
    * Enter the **redirect URI** for the app in the following format: `https://{Base_Url}/Auth/end`, `https://{Base_Url}/Auth/Start`. This will be the page where a successful implicit grant flow will redirect the user.
    Again
	* Select **Single page application**.
	* Enter the **redirect URI** for the app in the following format: `https://{Base_Url}/tabAuth`
	
    Enable implicit grant by checking the following boxes:  
    ✔ ID Token  
    ✔ Access Token  
14.  Navigate to the **Certificates & secrets**. In the Client secrets section, click on "+ New client secret". Add a description(Name of the secret) for the secret and select “Never” for Expires. Click "Add". Once the client secret is created, copy its value, it need to be placed in the appsettings.json.

### 2. Run your bot sample
1) Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```

2) In the folder where repository is cloned navigate to `samples/tab-request-approval/nodejs`

3) Install node modules

   Inside node js folder, open your local terminal and run the below command to install node modules. You can do the same in Visual studio code terminal by opening the project in Visual studio code 

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4) Run ngrok - point to port 3978

    ```bash
    ngrok http -host-header=rewrite 3978
    ```
5) Open the `.env` configuration file in your project folder (or in Visual Studio Code) and update the `ClientId` and `ClientSecret`, `TenantId` with your tenant id. For e.g., your ngrok url. (Note the ClientId is the AppId created in step 1 (Setup for Bot), the ClientSecret is referred to as the "client secret" in step 1 (Setup for Bot) and you can always create a new client secret anytime.)

6) Run your app

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
7) Manually update the manifest.json
    - Edit the `manifest.json` contained in the  `appPackage/` folder to replace with your MicrosoftAppId (that was created in step1.1 and is the same value of MicrosoftAppId in `.env` file) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `{MicrosoftAppId}` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - Zip up the contents of the `appPackage/` folder to create a `manifest.zip`
    - Upload the `manifest.zip` to Teams (in the left-bottom *Apps* view, click "Upload a custom app")

**Note:** App should be installed for user's manager also to get task approval notification.
