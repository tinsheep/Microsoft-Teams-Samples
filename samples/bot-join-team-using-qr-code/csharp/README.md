## Setup

1. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```

2. In a terminal, navigate to `samples/bot-join-team-using-qr-code/csharp`

3. Run ngrok - point to port 3978

   ```bash
   # ngrok http -host-header=rewrite 3978
   ```

4. Create a Azure Bot resource

  a) In Azure portal, create a [Azure Bot resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-authentication?   view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=userassigned%2Caadv2%2Ccsharp).

   - Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)

5. Modify the `manifest.json` in the `/AppManifest` folder and replace the `<<Microsoft-App-Id>>` with the id from step 2.

6. Zip the contents of `AppManifest` folder into a `manifest.zip`, and use the `manifest.zip` to deploy in app store or add to Teams as in step 

7. Modify the `/appsettings.json` and fill in the following details:
   - `{{ MicrosoftAppId }}` - Generated from Step 4.a is the application app id
   - `{{ MicrosoftAppPassword }}` - Generated from Step 4.a, also referred to as Client secret
   - `{{ ConnectionName }}` - Generated from Step 4.a, is the name that we provide while adding OAuth connection setting in Azure Bot resource.
    Please follow [Add authentication to bot](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/authentication/add-authentication?tabs=dotnet%2Cdotnet-sample#azure-ad-v2) to configure the connection.
   - `{{ ApplicationBaseUrl }}` - Your application's base url. E.g. https://12345.ngrok.io if you are using ngrok.

8. Upload the manifest.zip to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")
   - Go to Microsoft Teams. From the lower left corner, select Apps
   - From the lower left corner, choose Upload a custom App
   - Go to your project directory, the ./appPackage folder, select the zip folder, and choose Open.
   - Select Add in the pop-up dialog box. Your tab is uploaded to Teams
