## Different Formatting Cards

This sample shows the feature where user can use different formatting on adaptive cards using bot.

## Interaction with app

![Types Of Cards](Images/DifferentFormattingCards.gif)

## Try it yourself - experience the App in your Microsoft Teams client
Please find below demo manifest which is deployed on Microsoft Azure and you can try it yourself by uploading the app package (.zip file link below) to your teams and/or as a personal app. (Sideloading must be enabled for your tenant, [see steps here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading)).

**Send different formatting on cards:** [Manifest](/samples/bot-formatting-cards/nodejs/demo-manifest/bot-formatting-cards.zip)

## Prerequisites

-  Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account (not a guest account).
-  To test locally, [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) must be installed on your development machine (version 18x  or higher).
-  [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or equivalent tunneling solution.

## Setup

> Note these instructions are for running the sample on your local machine, the tunnelling solution is required because the Teams service needs to call into the bot.

1. Register a new application in the [Azure Active Directory â€“ App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.

2. Setup for Bot
- In Azure portal, create a [Azure Bot resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-authentication?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=csharp%2Caadv2).
- Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
- While registering the bot, use `https://<your_ngrok_url>/api/messages` as the messaging endpoint.

**NOTE:** When you create your bot you will create an App ID and App password - make sure you keep these for later.

3. Setup NGROK  
Run ngrok - point to port 3978

    ```bash
    ngrok http -host-header=rewrite 3978
    ```

4. Setup for code  
  - Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```

  - In a terminal, navigate to `samples/bot-formatting-cards/nodejs`
  - Update the `.env` configuration file and replace with placeholder `{{Microsoft-App-Id}}` and `{{Microsoft-App-Password}}`. (Note the MicrosoftAppId is the AppId created in step 1 (Setup AAD app registration in your Azure portal), the MicrosoftAppPassword is referred to as the "client secret" in step 1 (Setup for Bot) and you can always create a new client secret anytime.)

**Update mentionSupport json**
- Bots support user mention with the Azure AD Object ID and UPN, in addition to the existing IDs. The support for two new IDs is available in bots for text messages, Adaptive Cards body, and message extension response. Bots support the mention IDs in conversation and invoke scenarios. The user gets activity feed notification when being @mentioned with the IDs.

   - Navigate to samples\bot-formatting-cards\nodejs\resources\mentionSupport.json
      1) On line 14, replace {{new-Ids}}  
      2) On line 23, replace {{Email-Id}}
      3) On line 31, replace {{Microsoft-App-Id}}
        - E.g. 
        ```
        "text": "Hi <at>Adele UPN</at>, <at>Adele Azure AD</at>"
            }
        ],
        "msteams": {
            "entities": [
            {
                "type": "mention",
                "text": "<at>Adele UPN</at>",
                "mentioned": {
                "id": "AdeleV@contoso.onmicrosoft.com",
                "name": "Adele Vance"
                }
            },
            {
                "type": "mention",
                "text": "<at>Adele Azure AD</at>",
                "mentioned": {
                "id": "87d349ed-44d7-43e1-9a83-5f2406dee5bd",
                "name": "Adele Vance"
                }
            }
            ]
        ```

> In `index.js` file at line number 40, uncomment commented line for local debugging.

  - Install modules

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

  - Run your app

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

5. Setup Manifest for Teams
- __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the ./appPackage folder to replace your MicrosoftAppId (that was created when you registered your app registration earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `{{Microsoft-App-Id}}` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `validDomains` and replace `{{domain-name}}` with base Url of your domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok.io` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok.io`.
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `appPackage` folder to create a `manifest.zip` (Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)

- Upload the manifest.zip to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")
   - Go to Microsoft Teams. From the lower left corner, select Apps
   - From the lower left corner, choose Upload a custom App
   - Go to your project directory, the ./AppPackage folder, select the zip folder, and choose Open.
   - Select Add in the pop-up dialog box. Your app is uploaded to Teams.
