# Teams App Localization
This sample illustrates how to implement [Localization for Microsoft Teams apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/apps-localization).

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 10.14 or higher

    ```bash
    # determine node version
    node --version
    ```

## To try this sample

- Register a bot with Azure Bot Service, following the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration?view=azure-bot-service-3.0).
- Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
- While registering the bot, use `https://<your_ngrok_url>/api/messages` as the messaging endpoint.
    > NOTE: When you create your bot you will create an App ID and App password - make sure you keep these for later.

- Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```

- In a terminal, navigate to `samples\app-localization\nodejs`

    ```bash
    cd samples/app-localization/nodejs
    ```

- Install modules

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

- Start the bot

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
