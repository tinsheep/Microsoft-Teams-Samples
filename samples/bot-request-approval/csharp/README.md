## To try this sample

### Register your Teams Auth SSO with Azure AD
1. Register your app with Microsoft identity platform via the Azure AD portal
   - Your app must be registered in the Azure AD portal. See [Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2).

   - Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)

2. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
   ```

3. Open the code in Visual Studio
   - File -> Open -> Project/Solution
   - Navigate to folder where repository is cloned then `samples/bot-request-approval/csharp/BotRequestApproval.sln`
    
4. Run ngrok - point to port 3978

    ```bash
    # ngrok http -host-header=rewrite 3978
    ```
 
5. Setup and run the bot from Visual Studio: 
   Modify the `appsettings.json` and fill in the following details:
   - `MicrosoftAppId` - Generated from Step 1 (Application (client) ID)is the application app id
   - `MicrosoftAppPassword` - Generated from Step 1, also referred to as Client secret
   - Press `F5` to run the project
	 
6. Modify the `manifest.json` in the `/AppPackage` folder and replace the following details:
   - `{{Microsoft-App-Id}}` with Application id generated from Step 3
   - `{{domain-name}}` with base Url domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok.io` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok.io`.

7. Zip the contents of `AppPackage` folder into a `manifest.zip`, and use the `manifest.zip` to deploy in app store or add to Teams using step 8.

8. Upload the manifest.zip to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")
   - Go to Microsoft Teams and then go to side panel, select Apps
   - Choose Upload a custom App
   - Go to your project directory, the ./AppPackage folder, select the zip folder, and choose Open.
