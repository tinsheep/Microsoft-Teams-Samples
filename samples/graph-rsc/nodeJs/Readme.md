# RSC with Graph API

This sample illustrates you can use [Resource Specific Consent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/rsc/resource-specific-consent) to call Graph API.


## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or equivalent tunnelling solution

## To try this sample

1) Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```

1) In a terminal, navigate to `samples/graph-rsc/nodejs`

1) Install modules

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

1) Run ngrok - point to port 3978

    ```bash
    ngrok http -host-header=rewrite 3978
    ```


1) Update the `.env` configuration for the bot to use the Microsoft App Id and App Password from the Bot Framework registration. (Note the App Password is referred to as the "client secret" in the azure portal and you can always create a new client secret anytime.)

1) Run your bot at the command line:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

1) __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the  `teamsAppManifest` folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your bot earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `<<YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-ID>>` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `teamsAppManifest` folder to create a `manifest.zip`
    - **Upload** the `manifest.zip` to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")
