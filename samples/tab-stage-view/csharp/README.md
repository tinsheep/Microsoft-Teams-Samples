   - `{{BOT-ID}}` with the id from step 2.
   - `<<VALID DOMAIN>>` with your app domain e.g. *.ngrok.io

4. Zip the contents of `AppPackage` folder into a `manifest.zip`, and use the `manifest.zip` to deploy in app store or add to Teams as in step 7.

5. Modify the `/appsettings.json` and fill in the `{{ Bot Id }}` and `{{ Bot Password }}` with the id from step 2.

6. Add `{{ Application Base URL }}`in appsetting.json with ngrok tunnel url or deployed application base url. 

7. Upload the manifest.zip to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")
